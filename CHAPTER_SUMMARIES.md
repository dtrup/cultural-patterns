## Chapter 1: Introduction: The Quest for Patterns

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Word Count:** 3,441 | **Completed:** 2025-11-17

**Core Argument**: Humans are pattern-recognition machines whose evolved cognitive architecture generates systematic solutions to universal problems, resulting in recurring structures across religious traditions. These patterns emerge not from diffusion alone but from deep constraints on how minds, bodies, and cultures organize meaning.

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- Pattern recognition as evolved cognitive capacity (domain-specific modules, hyperactive agency detection, contamination intuitions)
- Religion as culturally specific category versus universal patterned phenomena (myth, ritual, practice, belief)
- Pattern science framework: analyzing patterns through cognitive, social, ecological, and historical dimensions
- Universal constraints generating local variation (not determinism, not relativism)
- Complementarity of interpretation and explanation (meaning and mechanism)

**Major Examples Used**:
- Sacred mountains across traditions (Mount Meru, Mount Fuji, Mount Sinai) demonstrating independent convergence
- Purification through water (Islamic wudu, Jewish mikveh, Hindu Ganges bathing) showing embodied cognition extending to symbolic purity
- Ancestor veneration (Chinese, Korean, West African, Polynesian) revealing kinship extension beyond death
- Hyperactive agency detection generating spirit-stones, devas, and supernatural agents
- Flood myths as narrative solutions to ecological catastrophe

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Chapter 1 established that patterns exist and emerge from universal constraints operating on local contexts. Chapter 2 provides the analytical framework—the four dimensions of cognitive, social, ecological, and historical analysis—for systematically examining what Chapter 1 claimed. The sacred mountain examples and purification patterns introduced here receive deeper dimensional analysis in Chapter 2's case studies.
