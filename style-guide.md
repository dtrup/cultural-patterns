# Style Guide: Cultural Pattern

## Voice & Tone

**Overall Approach**: Engaging-authoritative, elegant, sophisticated

This book speaks to intellectually curious readers who appreciate nuance, rigor, and accessible sophistication. The voice balances:
- **Scholarly credibility** without academic jargon
- **Narrative engagement** without oversimplification
- **Elegant prose** without pretension
- **Sophisticated analysis** without unnecessary complexity

## Core Principles

### 1. Avoid AI Clichés
❌ **Never use:**
- "Let's explore...", "Let's dive into...", "In this section, we..."
- Rhetorical questions as filler ("Have you ever wondered...?")
- "It's important to note...", "At the end of the day..."
- Lists of three with "Finally, ..." conclusions
- Over-explanation or hand-holding
- "Interestingly," as a transition word

✓ **Instead:**
- Direct statements and observations
- Specific examples before abstractions
- Implicit guidance through clear logic
- Trust reader intelligence

### 2. Elegance & Sophistication

**Sentence structure:**
- Vary sentence length: short declarative statements mixed with complex constructions
- Use subordinate clauses meaningfully (not just for variety)
- Avoid flabby constructions ("it is a fact that", "what we see here is")

**Word choice:**
- Favor precise, learned vocabulary over common words
- Use technical terms accurately when introduced
- Prefer "acquire" over "get", "disparate" over "different" (when appropriate)
- Avoid words that feel like ChatGPT clichés: "delve," "navigate," "simultaneously"

**Paragraph architecture:**
- Begin with specific observation or evidence, then generalize
- Each paragraph builds on previous reasoning
- Transitions connect logical threads, not just mark shifts

### 3. Engagement Through Example

**Show before telling:**
- Lead with case studies, concrete patterns, real instances
- Use worked examples before abstract frameworks
- Specific details create credibility and reader interest

**Visual specificity:**
- "The carved stone markers at Chaco Canyon align with cardinal directions" > "Ancient structures often show astronomical alignment"
- "A Balinese water temple manages rice terraces through ritual cycles" > "Religions can regulate resource management"

### 4. Pattern Science Terminology

**Core terms (use consistently):**
- Pattern complex
- Dimensional analysis (cognitive, social, ecological, historical)
- Cross-tradition comparison
- Pattern mapping
- Recognition vs. universals

**Avoid:**
- "Merely," "simply," "just" (undermines intellectual content)
- Over-qualification ("arguably," "perhaps," "somewhat")
- Hedging language that weakens claims

### 5. Structure & Flow

**Chapter architecture (standard):**
1. Opening case study (vivid, specific)
2. Pattern recognition section (what to see)
3. Dimensional breakdown (how patterns operate)
4. Cross-tradition comparison (scope and variation)
5. Mapping exercise or analysis lab
6. Counter-pattern analysis (where applicable)

**Transitions between sections:**
- Use subheading shifts, not transitional phrases
- Build logical momentum through content sequence
- Assume reader following your reasoning

### 6. Evidence & Authority

**Citation style:**
- Integrate sources naturally into prose
- Don't cite common knowledge
- Cite counterarguments and unusual claims
- Use parenthetical citations (Author Year) for notes

**Examples sourcing:**
- Primary sources and scholarly works
- Mix canonical and contemporary examples
- Cite specific works, not "many scholars argue"

### 7. Technical & Comparative Sections

**When comparing traditions:**
- Use parallel structure (same sequence, same depth per tradition)
- Avoid stereotyping: name variation within traditions
- Distinguish "dominant" from "minority" positions
- Acknowledge interpretation choices

**When explaining concepts:**
- Define technical terms on first use (briefly, in context)
- Use examples to illuminate definitions
- Avoid circular definitions

### 8. Accessibility Without Oversimplification

**Making sophisticated content accessible:**
- Start with observation, move to interpretation
- Explain "why this matters" without condescension
- Use structural clarity (headings, subheadings) for navigation
- Diagrams and tables for complex relationships

**Avoiding dumbing down:**
- Don't oversimplify trade-offs
- Name tensions and paradoxes openly
- Acknowledge genuine scholarly disagreement

## Prohibited Patterns

❌ **Never:**
- Use ALL CAPS for emphasis (use italics rarely, deliberately)
- Include parenthetical asides (rework into main text or footnote)
- Explain what you just said in different words (trust readers)
- Use "very," "really," "actually" as intensifiers
- Begin sentences with "Clearly," "Obviously," "Inevitably"
- Use em dashes excessively—they interrupt flow
- Rely on exclamation points for emphasis

## Tone by Section Type

**Case studies:** Vivid, immersive, sensory details, present tense where possible

**Theoretical sections:** Precise, clear, logical flow, active voice preferred

**Cross-tradition comparisons:** Even-handed, naming internal variation, scholarly rigor

**Practical exercises:** Direct, step-by-step, assume active reader engagement

## Editing Checklist

Before finalizing any section:
- [ ] No AI clichés (search: "let's", "interestingly", "dive into")
- [ ] Sentence variety (count short vs. long sentences)
- [ ] Each example serves specific purpose
- [ ] No unnecessary hedging
- [ ] Technical terms defined (if new to readers)
- [ ] Transitions happen through content logic, not phrases
- [ ] Voice consistent with chapter goals
- [ ] No tired metaphors or overused phrases
- [ ] Evidence sources clear
- [ ] Cross-tradition passages maintain parallel structure

## Voice Examples

**❌ Avoid:**
"Let's explore how different cultures have developed various approaches to creating supernatural agents. It's fascinating to note that across the world, from animistic societies to monotheistic religions, we see remarkably similar patterns."

**✓ Instead:**
"Supernatural agents emerge across cultures through predictable cognitive pathways. A Samoan spirit-stone, a Hindu deva, and an Islamic jinn operate through similar mechanisms despite their theological contexts."

**Remember:** Elegance serves clarity. Sophistication requires precision. Authority earns respect through evidence, not tone. Write for readers as intelligent as your ideas.
